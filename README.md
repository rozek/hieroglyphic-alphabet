# hieroglyphic-alphabet #

This repository contains several SVG and STL files for an ancient egyptian hieroglyphic alphabet.

A few days ago, I wanted to 3D-print the name of my wife in egyptian hieroglyphs as a surprize gift - but none of the already existing STL file sets really convinced me. As a consequence, I did some research, extracted single hieroglyphs from images I could find, simplified and vectorized them and finally converted the resulting SVG files into a format suitable for stereo litography.

These STL files may now easily be imported into many 3D modeling tools (including [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and most 3D printer sliders) and combined in whatever form you like.

### Tools Used ###

* [Photoline](https://www.pl32.de/) for image preparation
* [Bildvektorisierer](http://image-vectorizer.com/bildvektorisierer.html) for image vectorization
* [svg2stl](https://svg2stl.com/) for the final conversion into STL format (online)
